                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>Here are a few of my projects.</p>
                <p><b>CPRE 381: MIPS processecor:</b></p> <p>This was a semester long hardware related project that required me and a teammate to build a functional MIPS processecor
                from zero in VHDL. I was responsible for building the barrel shifter compenent as well as working with My teammate and I had to combine many parts we built individually in order  to
                turn the processor into something that would take MIPS assembly language and perform the instructions. My biggest individual contribution to the project was researching and building
                a barrel shifter compenent in VHDL for processor. This compenent is used with many instructions that require bits to be shifted. During this project I gained a large amount of
                experience coding in VHDL, learned a lot about the barebones logic compenents that go into building a CPU and why they are important for making the CPU run effectively.
                </p>
                <p><b>CPRE 231: Penetration Testing Project:</b></p>
                <p>
                This was one of my favorite projects while being at ISU. I was given the role as a new IT projessional at a theoretical company.
                My job was to go through the virtual machine given to me and conduct a thurough pentest to find any vulnerabilities and exploits on the system. Through this project I gained
                experience in using penetration testing methodoligies and techniques with NMAP, Metasploit, Wireshark, CVE Databases, and more to find and fix vulnerabilities within the virtual machines and their network.
                </p>
                <p><b>COM S 309: Habit Tracking Android Application </b></p>
                <p>In this project my group built an Android application that would track and give statistics regarding a user's habits. Habits could be created and assigned to multiple users, as well as be customized. My main role in creating this application was building the habit objects themselves as well as giving them their customizable functionalities like, repeatability, ue dates, and skills requried. I also built the dashboard that allows for viewing, searching and filtering of habits. From this projects I gained experience working with databases, Java programming for Android, and Springboot servers. </p>
                <p><b>Senior Design: Instructional Dashboard Web Application</b></p>
                <p>
                This project is currently a work in progress. For this project our client gave us the task of creating an Instructional dashboard web application that takes data from a program called Network Canvas
                and connect it with student canvas data to create an informational dashboard that can help instructors draw conclusions about classroom connections and performance based
                on various demographics. While I have roles in working in the front and backend of the project, my main role for this project is ensuring security of the web application and
                the data its handling. As the only CyberSecurity Engineer on the team, it is my job to make sure things are implemented and tested with security in mind. Throughout this project
                I will learn new skills like prorgamming in R, learning how to build dynamic web applications, as well as web application security testing.
