                <p>Here are a few of my projects.</p>

                <div>
                   CPRE 381: MIPS processor:</b></p> <p>This was a semester-long hardware-related project that required a teammate and me to build a functional MIPS processor from zero in VHDL. I was responsible for building the barrel shifter component and working with My teammate to combine the parts we built.to create a working processor that would read and perform MIPS assembly instructions. My biggest individual contribution to the project was researching and building a barrel shifter component in VHDL for the processor. This component is used with many instructions that require bits to be shifted. During this project, I gained a large amount of experience coding in VHDL. Along with that, I learned a lot about the barebones logic components that go into building a CPU and why they are essential for making the CPU run effectively.

                <p>
                  This was one of my favorite projects while being at ISU. I was given the role of a new IT professional at a made-up company. My job was to go through the virtual machine given to me and conduct a thorough penetration test of the companies network and computers to find any existing exploits and vulnerabilities on the system. Through this project, I gained experience in using penetration testing methodologies and using technical tools like NMAP, Metasploit, Wireshark, and CVE Databases. After finding the exploits and vulnerabilities, I researched ways to mitigate these threats and implement them into the system.

                <p><b>COM S 309: Habit Tracking Android Application </b></p>
                <p>In this project, my group built an Android application to track and give statistics regarding a user's habits. Habits could be created and assigned to multiple users, as well as be customized. My primary role in making this application was building the habit objects themselves and giving them their customizable functionalities like repeatability, due dates, and skills required. I also created a dashboard that allows for viewing, searching, and filtering of habits. I gained experience working with databases, Java programming for Android, and Springboot servers from this project.

                <p><b>Senior Design: Instructional Dashboard Web Application</b></p>
                <p>
                This project is currently a work in progress. For this project, our client gave us the task of creating an Instructional dashboard web application that takes data from a program called Network Canvas and connects it with student canvas data to create an informative dashboard that can help instructors draw conclusions about classroom connections and performance based on various demographics. While I have roles in working in the front and back end of the project, my primary role is to ensure the security of the web application and the data it is handling. As the only CyberSecurity Engineer on the team, it is my job to make sure everything is implemented and tested with security in mind. Throughout this project, I will learn new skills like programming in R, building dynamic web applications, and web application security testing.
